        <h2>Problem Statement: Audiobook Highlighting</h2>
      </a>
      <p>People interested in listening to audiobooks want to have a way to highlight the text while
        listening to it, so they can go back and listen to it again. Our solution would make it easy to find
        and listen to whatever part of the recording somebody would wish to hear.</p>
